Question,Risk Score Guidance,Risk,Uncertainty,Rationale
Is the species established in the assessment area,This question is meant to differentiate species that are not present in the assessment area (1) from species that are established in the assessment area (3). Species that are present in the assessment area but not established would score 2.,….,….,….
How frequently and in what numbers is the species expected to arrive into the assessment area?,"Consider initial arrival into the assessment area by primary vectors only. Do not consider secondary spread (anthropogenic or natural) within the assessment area by species that are already established. Consider all primary anthropogenic and natural vectors for transport into the assessment area (e.g., ballast water, hull fouling, aquaculture, rafting, and natural dispersal from outside the assessment area). ",….,….,….
How much of the assessment area offers suitable habitat for the species?,"This question is meant to differentiate habitat specialists (1) from habitat generalists (3). Species that fall between these extremes would score 2. First consider the species’ broad habitat zone (e.g., intertidal, subtidal, benthic, and pelagic). Then consider the proportion of that zone within the assessment area that offers suitable habitat for the species. Consider suitable anthropogenic habitat (e.g., docks and aquaculture sites) as well as natural habitat.",….,….,….
How much of the assessment area offers suitable environmental conditions for the species to survive?,"This question is meant to differentiate species with very poor environmental match for survival (1) from those with a very good environmental match (3). Species that fall between these extremes would score 2. Consider environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, and turbidity) in its suitable habitat (see Question 3).  Consider the most tolerant life stage at any time of year.  Consider survival only, not reproduction.",….,….,….
Are the species' reproductive requirements available in the assessment area?,"This question is meant to differentiate species that face severe constraints in reproduction in the assessment area and are very unlikely to reproduce in a typical year (1) from those that face few constraints in reproduction in the assessment area and are very likely to reproduce every year (3). Species that fall between these extremes would score 2.Consider any constraint (e.g., temperature, salinity, and stage-specific habitat) in the species’ ontogenetic development (e.g., spawning, fertilization, and propagule dispersal) that may affect its ability to reproduce successfully in otherwise suitable habitat (see Question 3).",….,….,….
To what extent could natural control agents slow the species' population growth in the assessment area?,"This question is meant to differentiate species with known, effective natural control agents in the assessment area (1) from those with no known, effective natural control agents in the assessment area (3). Species with known—but not necessarily effective—natural control agents in the assessment area would score 2. Consider presence and incidence of known natural control agents (e.g., predators, competitors, disease, and disturbance) in the species’ suitable habitat (see Question 3) and to what extent they could slow the species’ population growth.",….,….,….
What is the range of the species' potential natural dispersal in the assessment area?,"This question is meant to differentiate species that face severe constraints in natural dispersal (e.g., short larval planktonic stage and sessile adults) (1) from those that face few constraints (e.g., long larval planktonic stage, motile adults) (3). Species that fall between these extremes would score 2. Consider the natural dispersal vectors (e.g., currents, rafting, and migration) for all life stages. Consider any constraints on natural dispersal vectors in the assessment area.",….,….,….
What is the range of the species' potential dispersal in the assessment area from anthropogenic mechanisms?,"This question is meant to differentiate species likely to have little to no contact with anthropogenic mechanisms of dispersal in the assessment area (1) from those that are likely to have contact with anthropogenic mechanisms that could disperse them over large distances (e.g., among embayments) (3). Species that have contact with anthropogenic mechanisms that could disperse them over short distances (e.g., among sites in an embayment) would score a 2. Consider anthropogenic dispersal vectors (e.g., ballast, hull fouling, and aquaculture) for all life stages.",….,….,….
What level of impact could the species have on population growth of other species in the assessment area?,"Only consider impacts in the species’ suitable habitat (see Question 3). Consider positive and negative impacts (i.e. population increase or decrease). Consider impacts to indigenous and non-indigenous populations. Consider ecological impacts on aquaculture and commercially fished species, not economic impacts on the industry itself.",….,….,….
What level of impact could the species have on communities in the assessment area?,Only consider impacts in the species’ suitable habitat (see Question 3). Consider positive and negative impacts (i.e. population increase or decrease). Consider impacts to indigenous and non-indigenous populations. ,….,….,….
What level of impact could the species have on habitat in the assessment area?,"Only consider impacts in the species’ suitable habitat (see Question 3) and not on associated communities. Consider habitat engineering (e.g., reef-building organisms) and habitat destruction (e.g., bioturbating organisms).",….,….,….
What level of impact could the species have on ecosystem function in the assessment area?,"Only consider impacts in the species’ suitable habitat (see Question 3). Consider changes (positive or negative) to the physical, chemical, and biological processes that would normally maintain the ecosystem.",….,….,….
"What level of impact could the species' associated diseases, parasites, or travellers have on other species in the assessment area?",Only consider impacts in the species’ suitable habitat (see Question 3).,….,….,….
What level of genetic impact could the species have on other species in the assessment area?,Only consider impacts in the species’ suitable habitat (see Question 3). Consider indigenous and non-indigenous species in the assessment area. Consider hybridization (among species hybridization and supplementation of genetic material between strains or varieties of a species) as well as other genetic impacts.,….,….,….
What level of impact could the species have on at-risk or depleted species in the assessment area?,"Consider all possible impacts on species in the assessment area that are depleted, of extra value, or recognized as being at risk.",….,….,….
What level of impact could the species have on aquaculture and fished species in the assessment area?,"Consider ecological impacts on aquaculture and fished species (e.g., from commercial, recreational, and indigenous fisheries) in aquaculture operations and the wild, but not economic impacts on the industry itself.",….,….,….
Is the species known or generally considered to be invasive anywhere in the world?,This question is meant to differentiate species that are not invasive and not likely to be invasive based on their life history traits (1) from those that are known or generally considered to be invasive (3). An introduced species that is not generally considered to be invasive but that has traits related to invasiveness would score a 2. An introduced species can be non-invasive.,….,….,….
